<p><b>Top News</b> is a website for retrieving the latest news around the world. The project's purpose was to test my 
overall knowledge in React and API. The data is being obtained from https://developer.nytimes.com/apis. Apart from showing
the news, we have the option to filter news we are not interested in. 
Finally our website with the help of the API provides a fully functional search system, for searching international news.</p>

<b>Technologies: </b>
<p>React, HTML, CSS, Javascript</p>
